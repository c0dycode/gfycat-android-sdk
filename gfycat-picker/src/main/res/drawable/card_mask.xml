    <!-- We are cant crop rounded corners on pre-lollipop OS because of performance. In this case
     we using workaround - placing card mask on top of GfyCardView.
     This drawable works like rectangle stroke with rounded corners, but user can see only inner
     rectangle because of anti margins. Stroke width = -1 * anti margin. Stroke corner radius must
     be bigger than desired corner radius, because inner rectangle has smaller corner radius. -->
